## About this website: 
I have a restaurent called Bistro Boss. So, this is the website for the restaurent. This website contains all about it such as it's products, prices, customer's reviews etc. 

## Key feature of the project:

- This website has authentication system : email-password, google and github.
- Connected to mongoDB: This website uses mongoDB as it's database.
- Record user activity: The website will track your activity like product add to cart, order history etc.
- Admin panel: The admin of the project will have the access to remove a user, add a product, manage a product etc. But the normal users can't do that.
- This project has an eye pleasant color theme.
